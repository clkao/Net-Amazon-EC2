=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item instance_id (required)

The instance id you you are describing the attributes of.

=item block_device_mapping (optional)

of a virtual_name and a device_name. This should be a Net::Amazon::EC2::BlockDeviceMapping
object.

=item disable_api_termination (optional)

Specifies whether the instance can be terminated. You must modify this attribute 
before you can terminate any "locked" instances.

=item instance_initiated_shutdown_behavior (optional)

Specifies whether the instance's Amazon EBS volumes are deleted when the instance 
is shut down. 

=item instance_type (optional)

The instance type (e.g., m1.small, c1.medium, m2.2xlarge, and so on).

=item kernel (optional)

The kernel ID.

=item ramdisk (optional)

The RAM disk ID.

=item root_device_name (optional)

The root device name (e.g., /dev/sda1).

=item user_data (optional)
